  //   I’m Anand TP, a BCA student and fellow at NxtWave Academy, currently focused on building full-stack applications using the MERN stack.

  // I started my journey with Python, exploring data engineering concepts and Django, before moving into React and MERN to build complete, real-world web applications.

  // I spend most of my time building UI, fixing bugs, and understanding backend logic. I care deeply about clean UI, solid logic, performance, maintainable code, and good user experience.

  // My goal is to build full-stack projects without relying on tutorials, creating real-world web pages with full functionality, clear structure, and thoughtful design.
